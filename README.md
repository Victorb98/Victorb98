**⚡ Why I Love Cybersecurity**

It’s not about the glam or headlines. It’s about solving puzzles, outsmarting threats, and building defences that work. I’m drawn to protecting what matters with a mix of old school grit and new school tech. I respect the fundamentals of layered security, vigilance, and solid processes — because they stand the test of time.

I’m curious, sceptical, and hungry to learn everything from automation to threat intel. I don’t just react to attacks. I try to anticipate them, understand the attacker’s mind, and stay one step ahead. It’s a grind, but that’s what keeps me going.


**🛠️ **Tools & Tech I Use (Still Learning)** **

Splunk, Sigma, Wireshark, tcpdump

Linux (Ubuntu, Kali) & Windows environments

Python scripting for automation 

VirtusTotal 

TryHackMe & Hack The Box labs for continuous learning
