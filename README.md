**⚡ Why I Love Cybersecurity**

It’s not about the glam or headlines. It’s about solving puzzles, outsmarting threats, and building defences that work. I’m drawn to protecting what matters with a mix of old school grit and new school tech. I respect the fundamentals of layered security, vigilance, and solid processes because they stand the test of time.

I’m curious, sceptical, and hungry to learn everything from automation to threat intel. I don’t just react to attacks. I try to anticipate them, understand the attacker’s mind, and stay one step ahead. It’s a grind, but that’s what keeps me going.


**🛠️ **Tools & Tech I Use (Still Learning)** **

Splunk & Sigma — Building detection rules and alerts to spot real threats 🎯🚨

Wireshark & tcpdump - Analysing network traffic to catch sketchy activity 📡🔍

Linux (Ubuntu, Kali) & Windows — System hardening, command-line ninja moves, and troubleshooting 🐧🪟🔧

Python Scripting — Automating repetitive SOC tasks and log parsing 🤖📝

VirusTotal — Investigating suspicious files and URLs with threat intelligence 🔎🦠

TryHackMe & Hack The Box — Hands-on labs and challenges for continuous skill grinding 🎮🔥
